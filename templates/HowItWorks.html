        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">When users create a Mail, it is validated and saved to the FUTUREMAIL Cloud Storage. It is securely stored and ready to mailed on the User's Selected Choice Date. Because the project is a small scale passion project, the mailing time is not relevant to the Mail creation hours minute time, but the mails are delivered at a predetermined hour of the day of the selected date, which is done to decrease the server costs. The project is built using the <i>Django Framework.</i> Thank you </p>
